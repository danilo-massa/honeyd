Honeyd scripts used to emulate services, broken down
by operating system.  Note, many of the scripts included
were done by Fabian Bieker <fabian.bieker@web.de>.  His
scripts call on the logging script misc/base.sh, which is
used for additional logging.  You may want to include this
with other scripts.
